Route Optimization System -

This C++ program implements Dijkstra's algorithm for optimizing routes between cities based on distance and time criteria. and finds the best path for the person to travel from source to destination.



Overview-

The program simulates a route optimization system where cities are nodes in a graph, and paths between cities are edges with associated weights (distance or time). Dijkstra's algorithm is utilized to compute the shortest path from a specified source city to a destination city based on either distance or time.



Features-

City Representation: Cities are represented using a City structure containing an ID and name.
Graph Representation: Paths between cities are defined with distance and time attributes.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Computes shortest paths in graphs represented as adjacency lists based on distance and time criteria.
Path Visualization: Outputs the shortest path in a readable format from the source city to the destination city based on the chosen criteria.
